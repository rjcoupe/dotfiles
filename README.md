# dotfiles for Codespace usage

Thanks to [@bstollnitz](https://github.com/bstollnitz), her [wonderful article](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/codespaces-terminal/) explaining how to enhance Codespaces using dotfiles and her [example files](https://www.github.com/bstollnitz/dotfiles) which I'm shamelessly using as my own here.

Dotfiles are executed (if the setting is enabled within your Github user settings) as part of a Codespace creation, giving you cross-repository commonality in your development environments.
